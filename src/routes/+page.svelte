    <p>
      Hi there! I'm Patrick, and I'm a computer science Masters student at
      Virginia Tech studying artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data
      analytics.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love learning and experimenting with new technologies, and I am
      constantly working on cool new <a href="{base}/projects">projects</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am currently working on an AI-powered prospecting application for <a
        href="https://navagant.com/">Navagant</a
      >, a Bluesky bot detection system, and a
      <a href="https://github.com/ptdewey/rooibos"
        >programmatic resume generator</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm somewhat obsessed with optimizing every part of my developer workflow,
      and I've written vim plugins and cli/tui applications to try and be
      blazingly fast in everything I do.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also have a <a href="{base}/writing">blog</a> where I
      <em>occasionally</em>
      write articles.
